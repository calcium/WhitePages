# WhitePages
This has python code to screen scrape the whitepages.com.au website for Residential.

Apparently, there is an API.
http://developers.sensis.com.au/member/register

But webpage says. Registration is currently disabled.

So screen scraper it is.

### Example usage
```
$ python whitepages.py surname firstname postcode
```

The return value seems unusual cos it's meant to be read back by Amazon Lex.
